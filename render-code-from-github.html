<h1>Render Code stored in repository</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Code reuse principles warrant storing code snippets apart from the way they are used or are presented. Github is a useful place to maintain code smippet repositories, but there is not a straightforward way to reuse those snippets in Canvas.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
Github does not allow extracting the raw code from its server to be able to reuse elsewhere, within an iFrame or otherwise. The workaround involves working with a third party API which extracts the code using the github API and then wraps that code with the approprate <code>Content-Type</code> headers.

<p>The workaround is to:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Find the raw file text url that you want to include. This can be a file on the main branch of a github repositoty, a feature branch, a tagged version, or a github gist.</li>
  <li>Enter that url into <a href="raw.githack.com" target="_blank">raw.githack.com</href></li>
  <li>Select the appropriate url (production or development)</li>
  <li>Use that url within an iFrame</li>
  <li>If you used a development url, be sure to update the url to a production url after you're satisfied with the source code. If necessary, you can purge cached urls if you make a change to source code referenced by a production url</li>
</ol>

<p>The following is an example of an rendered code from a gist file. This gist provides sliders to change the inputs into an ordinary differential equation. We don't know anything about it, and we provide it here simply for demo purposes. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/wbwatkinson/c4656aaa0f4f7f4b303ab3476e672512", target="_blank">gist is available on github</a>. The production url generated by <a href="https://raw.githack.com/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/wbwatkinson/c4656aaa0f4f7f4b303ab3476e672512/raw/1953cf7437c624ea03987e61303cbea7eb7bd761/ode_test_iframe.html", target="_blank">raw.githack.com</a> is <pre>https://gistcdn.githack.com/wbwatkinson/c4656aaa0f4f7f4b303ab3476e672512/raw/1953cf7437c624ea03987e61303cbea7eb7bd761/ode_test_iframe.html</pre></p>

<p>We insert the above url into an iframe tag to render the following interactive widget. In your own application, you'll want to experiment with the height attributes or use developer tools to find the height so that the iFrame can be rendered without scrollbars.</p>

<p><iframe style="height: 1058;" src="https://gistcdn.githack.com/wbwatkinson/c4656aaa0f4f7f4b303ab3476e672512/raw/1953cf7437c624ea03987e61303cbea7eb7bd761/ode_test_iframe.html" width="100%" height="1058">
