<h1>Display Code with Syntax Highlighting</h1>

<p>Problem: The Canvas page editor provides &lt;pre&gt; tags, but content within those tags is not rendered with syntax highlighting. However, gist.github provides a javascript a script which can be embedded in a page. This is not a complete solution, however, as Canvas does not allow using &lt;script&gt; in the Canvas HTML editor.</p>
<p>Solution: The workaround is to:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Inject the appropriate &lt;script&gt; tags in an HTML file</li>
  <li>Save that HTML file in the Canvas file section</li>
  <li>Load that HTML file into the Canvas page with an iFrame</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Note:</i> Accessing the files saved in the Canvas file repository is non-obvious. The following is the general structure:</p>

<pre>[course_root_url]/file_contents/course%20files/[file_path_in_canvas_files]</pre>

<p>For example, assuming you've saved a file at <code>test/my_example.html</code> in a course with a url of <code>https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/99999999/</code>, the url to access the file is:</p>

<pre>https://lms.au.af.edu/courses/99999999/file_contents/course%20files/test/my_example.html</pre>

<p>The following is an example of the HTML file that would be loaded into the Canvas files section (we've loaded this sample via the iFrame function). You may need to experiment with the height to display the entire frame without scroll bars (developer tools can assist to identify the height of the iFrame).</p>
